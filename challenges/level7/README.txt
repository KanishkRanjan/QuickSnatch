Welcome to the Archive Challenge!

The flag is hidden in a nested archive structure:
1. First, you'll find archive.tar.gz
2. Inside it, there's level1.zip
3. Inside level1.zip, there's a secret folder
4. Inside the secret folder, you'll find flag.txt

Commands you'll need:
- tar -xzf archive.tar.gz
- unzip level1.zip
- cd secret
- cat flag.txt

The flag is: flag{archive_master_explorer}
